 Program Name : MyNote.
  MyNote is like 'Sticky Notes' in windows. It helps to create simple notes. These notes are stored with timestamp in a database table.
  It has a menu, which allows to select different options. To create a new note, view all notes, search for a note on a particular date, and clear all notes.
  When selecting the option to clear all the notes, the user is prompted to confirm again. Only after giving the user's code, all the notes will be cleared from the table.
